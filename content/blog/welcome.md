This is a demo blog post to show how the blog works. In this post I will be talking about how to use the blog and what you can do with it.

## Formatting

supastarter also includes formatting for all common markdown elements. You can write **bold**, _italic_, and ~~strikethrough~~ text. You can also write code inline like `const x = 1` or in a block:

```typescript
// my awesome code snippet
if (true) {
  console.log('hello world')
}
```

Of course you can also use lists:

- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3

If you want to add a horizontal rule you can do that too:
