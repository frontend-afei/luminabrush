# Supastarter Nuxt (WIP!)

## How to get going?

Some tasks you should probably do in the beginning are:

- [ ] install the Vue Volar VSCode extension
- [ ] enable [Volar takeover mode](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#prerequisites) to ensure a smooth editor setup
- [ ] Prisma: Run `npx prisma db push` to sync the schema to your database & generate the Prisma Client

### Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```
